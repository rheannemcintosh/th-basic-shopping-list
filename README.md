# Basic Shopping List :shopping:

## Project Overview
The Basic Shopping List Application is a basic Python command line application which I created at the start of my Python journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-application). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse tutorial, with some small edits along the way. Then a separate pull request was created to ensure the code followed PEP8 Standards.
